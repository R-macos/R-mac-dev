<h1>R for macOS Developers</h1>

This is the new home for experimental binaries and documentation related to R for macOS. To learn more about the R software or download released versions, please visit <a href=https://www.r-project.org/>www.r-project.org</a>.

<b><i>All software on this page is strictly experimental and subject to acceptance of the supplied R license agreement and the disclaimer at the end of the page.</i></b>

<b>Important note about R 4.0.0</b><br/><br/>
Starting with R 4.0.0 alpha we are building R using standard Apple tools (Xcode 12.4) and GNU Fortran 8.2 from <a href=https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases>fxcoudert</a> and the target is macOS 10.13 (High Sierra). All dependent static libraries are available in the <a href=/libs-4/>libs-4</a> directory. Please make sure you remove any modifications to build flags from your home since no custom compilers are used anymore. For more information about alternative OpenMP options (as in older version) see <a href=openmp>the openmp page</a> of this site.
<p>
<b>Apple silicon update</b>: it is now possible to build R for the Apple silicon arm architecture (new Macs with the M1 processor) - see <a href="https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2020/11/02/will-r-work-on-apple-silicon/index.html">our R developer blog post</a> and the instructions in the R manual. The plan is to have an official native arm release of R 4.1.0, but in the meantime we intend to provide native builds of R-devel here - see "big-sur" builds for <i>arm64</i> below and more details in the <a href="#M1">Apple silicon</a> section. Note that the tools are still highly experimental so the arm build is also experimental and things may change as we go. That said, our current Intel releases work just fine on the new Macs as well using Rosetta 2.

<h2>Nightly builds for macOS</h2>
<h3>R framework</h3>

<!--include R-builds.html-->

<p><font color=#800>Important:</font> The <b>big-sur</b> builds are compatible with the M1 arm-based Macs <u>only</u>. Intel Macs are supported by the <b>high-sierra</b> build which works on any macOS &gt;=10.13 including Big Sur. 
<p>
The installer image (<tt>*.pkg</tt>) is packaged exactly the same way as the CRAN release of R (including the GUI) and it will update your R version (unless you use <tt>pkgutil</tt> - see instructions during installation and/or the <i>"Multiple versions"</i> <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#Multiple-versions">section of the R Installation and Administration manual</a>).

<p>
Alternatively, you can use the tar-ball (<tt>*.tar.gz</tt>) in the table above. The tar-ball must be unpacked in the root directory using:
<blockquote>
$ <tt>tar fvxz R*.tar.gz -C /</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>
NOTE: The tar-ball does not contain the GUI (see below for a separate download).

<p>
NOTE: The installer includes Tcl/Tk package which will install in <tt>/usr/local</tt>. It is optional (only needed for the <tt>tcltk</tt> R package) and can be unchecked at installation time.
<p>
If you see any issues with the builds, please contact Simon Urbanek (the macOS maintainer of R) or report on the R-SIG-Mac mailing list.
<p>

<a name=gui></a>
<h3>Mac OS X GUI</h3>

<!--include GUI.html-->

<p>To install, open the image and drag the <b>R</b> icon to your <tt>Applications</tt> folder. Alternatively the GUI can be run directly off that image without copying if you just want to test it. Build configurations with "64" suffix are 64-bit builds, all others are 32-bit (except for Debug). If you want to use both, rename one of them or place them in different directories.

<a name=tools></a>
<h2>Tools</h2>

In order to compile R and R packages you will need <b>Xcode Developer Tools</b> and a Fortran compiler. For details and download, please read the <a href=/tools/>Tools page</a>. The R 4.0.0 and higer binaries are built using Xcode 11.4.

<h2>CRAN macOS master</h2>
This is now the master repository for released R package binaries. If you have issues with other mirrors, try using <tt>https://mac.r-project.org/</tt> as your mirror as it is updated first.

<a name=M1></a>
<h2>Apple silicon (aka arm64, aarch64, M1)</h2>

To avoid clashes with the Intel builds, we use separate tools and libraries for the <tt>arm64</tt> builds of R on macOS. This is only relevant if you want to compile R packages yourself. All tools and libraries live in <tt>/opt/R/arm64</tt> including the GNU Fortram compiler and you can download them from <a href=/libs-arm64>libs-arm64</a>. It is assumed that <tt>/usr/local</tt> is unsafe as it may contain Intel binaries which don't mix, therefore R will not try to use <tt>/usr/local</tt> unless a manual flags override is issued. However, it also means that it is safe to use our arm binaries without affecting your legacy Intel ecosystem.

<p>
The <b>big-sur</b> arm64 build of R requires <a href=https://www.xquartz.org target=_new>XQuartz</a> 2.8.0_rc1 or higher to use the X11 components.

<a name=old></a>
<h2>Legacy R</h2>
The current build supports only macOS X 10.13 (High Sierra) or higher. Older versions of macOS are not supported in binary form, but R can be compiled from sources for such legacy OS versions. Last released version for Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) was <b>R 2.10.1</b>, last release for Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) was <b>R 2.15.3</b>, last release for Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) was <b> R 3.6.3</b>.

<a name=other></a>
<h2>Other binaries</h2>

The following binaries are not maintained or supported by R-core and are provided without any guarantee and for convenience only (Mac OS X 10.4.4 or higher required). They match the binaries used on the CRAN binary build machine and thus are recommended for use with CRAN R package binaries.
<ul>
<li><b>GTK+ 2.24.17 framework</b> - 64-bit build of GTK+ 2.24.17, necessary for binary R packages that use GTK+ version 2 (such as RGtk2+). <i>R 3.0.0 and higher, Snow Leopard build</i><br>
Download: <a href=/libs/GTK_2.24.17-X11.pkg>GTK_2.24.17-X11.pkg</a> (ca. 41MB)<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>GTK+ 2.18.5 framework</b> - universal build of GTK+ 2.18.5, necessary for binary R packages that use GTK+ version 2 (such as RGtk2+). <i>R 2.10.0 - 2.15.3, Leopard build</i><br>
Download: <a href=/libs/GTK_2.18.5-X11.pkg>GTK_2.18.5-X11.pkg</a> (ca. 58MB)<br>&nbsp;
<li><b>RSwitch</b> - a small GUI that allows you to switch between R versions quickly (if you have multiple versions of R framework installed).<br>
Download: <a href=RSwitch-1.2.dmg>RSwitch-1.2.dmg</a> (ca 67kB, universal, <font color=red>updated 2011/03/24</font> to support R 2.13.0 and up)<br>
Sources: <a href=RSwitch-1.2.tar.gz>RSwitch-1.2.tar.gz</a> (Xcode project and sources)<br>
<p>
NOTE: Bob Rudis is maintaining a new version of a tool which has RSwitch functionality and more - see <a href=https://git.rud.is/hrbrmstr/RSwitch target=_new>3rd party RSwitch replacement</a> (NOT related to R-Foundation or CRAN!).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
More external libraries for R 4.0.0 and higher can be found in the <a href=/libs-4/>/libs-4/</a> directory. For older versions see the <a href=/libs>/libs/</a> directory.
